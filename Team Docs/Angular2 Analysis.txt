ANGULAR2 ANALYSIS
*****************

COMPATIBILITY
*************
   BOOTSTRAP SUPPORT
      Valor Software's has a library called Angular Bootstrap. They seem to
      support all core Bootstrap components. Using it seems to be a simple case
      of replacing the jQuery imports with the appropriate Angular ones. I
      showed the example code for several components to Kevin and he said it
      looked very similar; there likely won't be any issue porting code over
      to this library.

   FIREBASE SUPPORT
      AngularFire2 library is "the official library for Firebase and Angular2"
      Initially scoping out the page looks like it won't be any problem.

   GESTURES
      HammerJS is the top search result I came across. It seems super
      responsive. It supports all your standards, and the demo widget they have
      on their main github page is definitely convincing. Initial browsing of
      Google indicates that it works with Angular2, so I'd say we're good to go
      on that. http://hammerjs.github.io/

   DRAG-TO-REORDER
      It's made by Valor Software (the same guys who did the Angular Bootstrap
      library), so chances are it's going to work smoothly. Also, it's called
      "Dragula." 'nuff said. https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula
