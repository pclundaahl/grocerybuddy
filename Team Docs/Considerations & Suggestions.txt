CONSIDERATIONS / SUGGESTIONS
============================

- Extra validation (such as Captcha)
- Undo feature
- On LIST: Group checked / unchecked items together.
- Alter nav button color.
- Look at how smart fridges handle the fridge management.
- Some layouts are a bit busy (not specific). Should spend time seeing how minimal we can get each page.
- Double-tap is a weird gesture for options. Perhaps consider click-and-hold or dot-dot-dot icon.
